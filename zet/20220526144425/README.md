# Long term food storing, specially grains.
Storing food in a safe way for long term, comes down to handling moisture, light, bugs and rodents.
Have these things under control and your food will last a long long time. For instance wheat beans (seeds) will last up to 20 - 30 years!
## Mylar bag method
One way to store (and the one im must inclined to do) is to get Mylar bags, place some oxygen absorbers inside (just make sure you put in enough packs of 
oxygen absorbers for the volume capacity of the bag. The oxygen absorber should have the information of how much one pack can absorb),
leave a good amount of bag space free, use the left over space to close the bag using heat (for instane you can use an ironing machine to do it)
and store in a cool place. To help deal with rodents (the one thing mylar bags are not good against) you can store the bag inside a plastic bucket.
The oxygen absorbers helps to control bugs, because bugs can´t live without oxygen. That's the reason to use them.

Stored seeds can sprout. So in case of a total society melt down where there´s very little food. 
You can plant some seeds and start producing food (hopefully this won´t be needed). Altough, storing conditions and the age of the seed will play a huge part
in whether or not the seed can sprout. There's a rumour that if you use oxygen absorbent the seed can´t sprout
but it looks like this is fake.
