# How to harvest wheat

First you need to cut the plant. We cut from the vertical middle of the plant, when the top part of the plant already has seeds.
Once cut we will store the harvested plants in a dry place where they can be left alone to dry up. Wen they are dry
we can go ahead and separate the top part of it (where the actual seeds are stored). 
To make the separation process easier, we can place the plants on a container and use a weed wacker to force the top parts to separate.
Once thats done, we need to separate the remainings of the stems and the top parts. We can use a filter screen to make it easier.

The seed is covered by two layers of protection, so in order to remove these protections we can hit our remaining product.
Last we only need to use a fan to blow out the removed protections and we just have a pure wheat grain left.
