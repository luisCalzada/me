# What is the terminal in computers?

Now a days the terminal we are used to is actually a terminal emulator. 
Because it's emulating the way old terminals communicated instructions to computers.
Prior to terminals we had teletypes to do the same thing. The difference was that a teletype
is like a typewriter over a wire to send the instructions. The terminal is more computer like.
And all of this just replaced the old punch cards used to program computers.

Fun fact: Terminals introduced the 80 columns width. Now a days it's good practice to not write a line
of code longer than 80 cols because of it.
