# What is the Shell in computers?
The Shell is a program, that most commonly is a CLI but it's not mandatory, to interact with the Kernel of the computer.
It basically makes our life easier, because instead of having to write C instructions to run system calls to do anything,
we can just call a Shell command to handle that for us. 

Here you can find a visual reference for the structure this has.
