# What is CLI?
CLI stands for Command Line Interface and sometimes it can be called a REPL, which stands for
Read, Evaluate, Print, Loop. Because that's exactly what a CLI does.
You give it an instruction (Read), It determines what to do, does it, prints to you the output and then 
we repeat the process.

Technically speaking, you can have a CLI without a terminal. 
For example if you have a website and there's an input field not sanitized. You could interact with a CLI using 
this input and you don't need a terminal. Tho in most cases to interact with a CLI you will be using a terminal.
