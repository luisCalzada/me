# Uncontrolled Components vs Controlled Components
Uncontrolled components are those components (mostly used when talking about forms)  that are not linked
to the UI. Meaning the UI won't know if the component changed values and can't act accordinly.
So it's just like a vanilla version of html forms and inputs.

Controlled components are attached to the UI and have a way to access the values without having to click a submit button.
For instances when in a vanilla html site you use jquery o vanilla js to attach a listener for when the value of an input
changes.
